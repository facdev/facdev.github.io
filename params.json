Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n\r\nFor continously inspecting our code, we use Scrutinizer CI. You can find all runs\r\non our code base [here](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/bolt/bolt/inspections).\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nDetailed instructions can be found in the \r\n[Installation section in the documentation](http://docs.bolt.cm/installation).\r\n\r\nReporting issues\r\n----------------\r\nWhen you run into an issue, be sure to provide some details on the issue.\r\nPlease include with your report:\r\n- the (example) input;\r\n- the output you expected;\r\n- the output actually produced.\r\n\r\nThis way we can reproduce your issue, turn it into a test and prevent the issue from occurring in future versions.\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n----------\r\nFor running unit tests you need [phpunit](http://www.phpunit.de/)\r\n\r\nAfter installing, you can run the unit test suite by running\r\n\r\n    $ phpunit -c app/\r\n\r\nThis can now also be done by using app/nut:\r\n\r\n    $ php app/nut tests:run\r\n\r\nExtensions\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After*  publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
